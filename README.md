# Problem B: Car Accident Analyasis (Med) 
Group Accuracy: 93%

This problem is like the first question but you get accident data with tons of different parameters ~30. And you have to predict which source 1 or 0, the data comes from.
The data is messed up and has missing values, we first cut out any with missing values, and only computer the source off the first 7 parameters in the dataset, this gave us 93% accuracy on our first test

# Problem C: Fungi Classification (Hard)
Group Accuracy: 22%

This problem consits of 5 different fungi types, trained on 1000 really messed up photos of each, the testing data is clean however which gave us some problems.
This was the hardest of the 3 questions, we attempted to classify the images based on the frequency of pixel values and the hue.
